# GGXXACPR_Framework
A partial Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R mod that attempts to export the game state to SAMMI or similar WebSocket-aware software.
Currently partially functional. It only allows access to a few variables that aren't super useful.
Currently on indefinite hiatus. You are welcome to do whatever you like with this code.

You definitely can't cheat with this code, so don't even try and don't get on my ass about it either.
